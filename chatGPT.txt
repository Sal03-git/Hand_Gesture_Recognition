To get the Bluetooth MAC address for your SpeedyBee module, follow these steps:

1. Finding the Bluetooth MAC Address on Your Laptop (Windows)
Pair SpeedyBee with your laptop:
Make sure your SpeedyBee module is powered on and in Bluetooth pairing mode.
Open Bluetooth settings on your laptop and pair it with the SpeedyBee module.
Find the MAC address:
After pairing, you can usually find the MAC address in the Bluetooth settings:
On Windows:
Open Settings > Devices > Bluetooth & other devices.
Find your SpeedyBee module in the list of paired devices.
Click on the device, and you might find details such as the MAC address.
Using bluetooth (Linux/Windows):
On Linux, you can use the bluetoothctl command:

bash
Copy code
bluetoothctl
Then, type paired-devices to list the devices and their MAC addresses.

On Windows, you can also use the Bluetooth Command Line Tools to list the paired devices and their MAC addresses.

2. Finding the Bluetooth MAC Address on Your Laptop (MacOS)
Pair SpeedyBee with your laptop:

Ensure your SpeedyBee module is in Bluetooth pairing mode.
Go to System Preferences > Bluetooth, and pair with the SpeedyBee module.
Find the MAC address:

Open Terminal and type the following command to list Bluetooth devices:

bash
Copy code
system_profiler SPBluetoothDataType
This will show a list of Bluetooth devices and their MAC addresses.

3. Alternatively, Use a Bluetooth Scanning Tool
You can use a Bluetooth scanning tool (like Bluetooth View on Windows or LightBlue Explorer on macOS/Windows) to scan for nearby Bluetooth devices. These tools will list the MAC addresses of all nearby Bluetooth devices, including your SpeedyBee.

Example:
Once you have the MAC address of SpeedyBee, you can replace "XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX" in the code with the actual MAC address of your SpeedyBee. For example:

python
Copy code
speedybee_address = "00:1A:7D:DA:71:13"
Let me know if you need any additional details or help with finding the address!
